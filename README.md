LongWriter: Unleashing 10,000+ Word Generation From Long Context LLMs

Here's a simplified version of the Longwriter:
The Problem:
 * Large language models (LLMs) can handle very long inputs but struggle to produce very long outputs.
 * This is because these models are trained on examples with shorter outputs.
The Solution:
 * The authors created a method called AgentWrite to break down long writing tasks into smaller ones.
 * This allows existing LLMs to produce longer and more coherent text.
 * They also created a dataset called LongWriter-6k to help train models to write even longer text.
In essence, AgentWrite helps LLMs write longer and better text by breaking down tasks and providing more training data.

Problem:
 * Existing language models (LLMs) find it difficult to write very long text.
Solution:
 * Create a plan: Break down the long writing task into smaller parts with specific word counts for each part.
 * Write each part: Use the LLM to write each smaller part one by one.
 * Check the result: Make sure the final text is long enough and good quality.
To improve the LLMs for writing longer text:
 * Collect data: Gather lots of examples of long text.
 * Train the model: Teach the LLM to write longer text using the collected data.
By following these steps, the researchers were able to create language models that can write much longer text than before.
